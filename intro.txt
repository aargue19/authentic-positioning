Introduction

Recently, many important scholars have called for studies that extend optimal distinctiveness theory to account for factors such as the dynamism of modern product markets.   
One important reason for this is that not much study has been devoted to exploring the role audiences and their social evaluations play in determining how producers successfully position their products.
Successful organizations position themselves by striking a strategic balance between conformity to and differentiation from established market categories. 
Being similar to rivals means audiences perceive them to be legitimate; being different allows them to carve out a distinct piece of the market and leverage competitive advantages. 
Institutional theory and strategic management scholars describe the ideal trade-off between these two countervailing forces as optimal distinctiveness. 
It is well understood that for organizations and their products, being positioned somewhere in the "middle range" leads to better outcomes than offerings that are too similar or different. 

Yet, despite much excellent research into outcomes associated with optimal distinctiveness, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still relatively ambiguous. 
Our understanding of the broader relationship between categorization and performance is hindered by at least two assumptions the extant literature makes about the social evaluation process. 
First, it is typically assumed that producers are 'market-takers' operating within the confines of 'taken-for-granted' or fixed market categories. 
Second, the attributions made by producers are usually treated by researchers as 'taken-as-gospel', i.e. they generally do not contend with the possibility that perceptions of organizations and their consumers may not agree. 
However, a recent strand in the literature has begun to emphasize authenticity as an important social evaluation construct. 
We believe that accounting for authenticity is an important step in extending optimal distinctiveness theory because, in reality, consumers do not necessarily take categorical claims of producers 'on faith'. 

In this paper we suggest that optimally distinct market positioning is mediated by the authentication of social actors and their evaluations. 
By tracking the evolution of products' categorization by social evaluators over time we contrast the performance trajectories of products whose initial positioning is ultimately authenticated or rejected by consumers.
Products are re-categorized by audiences over time such that initial attributions of authentically positioned products are reinforced and inauthentic attributions are diminished over time. 
Authentic products are drawn towards the middle of the IUC and those deemed inauthentic pushed to the extremes of differentiation spectrum, which determines their performance.
This polarizing force that social evaluation exerts on products help us to explain why optimal distinctiveness typically exists somewhere in the "middle range".
We conceptualize optimal distinctiveness as being determined not only by how products conform to norms or schema of social categories but how connections between relevant social actors are formed.   

To test these claims empirically, we gather data from an online marketplace for personal computer (PC) video games called Steam.
As with many modern online product platforms, the products on Steam are organized using a tag-based categorization system.
Initially, when a producer releases a new product they make claims of category membership by applying up to 20 categorical tags to their product.
However, once products are released their corresponding tags change as new and existing ones are voted on by consumers.
This provides us with a unique a research opportunity as it allows us to observe the degree to which a producerâ€™s initial positioning in market categories is authenticated or rejected by audiences over time.

We expect that even when a producer positions their product as optimally distinct, if their attributions are unsubstantiated a different kind of legitimacy discount will be applied by audiences. 
Conversely, as audiences re-categorize products over time, the audience plays a role in bringing products that are marginally too conforming or distinctive into the high-performing middle range.
By incorporating a temporal dimension into our observation of optimal market categorization we offer new insight into how dynamic forces influence producers and product markets.
Our theoretical framework is among the first to integrate two kinds of legitimacy discounts applied by social actors: conformity and connection.
This has important consequences for our understanding of the role authenticity plays in mediating the effects of optimal distinctiveness on performance by accounting for the dynamic influence of social evaluations.
We now turn to our literature review to explore these ideas in greater detail.
